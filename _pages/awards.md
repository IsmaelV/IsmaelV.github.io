Below is a list of awards that I have won either as recognitions or as funding (e.g., grants, scholarships, fellowships).

## Chair's Award for Best Student Paper @ CompEd 2025
Very happy to say that my paper on how computer science faculty racial identities may affect how they may (or may not) leverage culture inside the classroom at Hispanic-Serving Institutions! Check out the paper here: https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3736181.3747163

I presented this work for the 2025 ACM Global Computing Education (CompEd) Conference in Gaborone, Botswana. I had a lovely time and all the other papers nominated were also outstanding! Highly recommend this conference in the future to all who read this.
