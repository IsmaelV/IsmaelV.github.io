<h2>Teaching Philosophy</h2>

<p>During graduate school, I have served in diverse teaching roles (from teaching assistant to instructor of record) for courses ranging from small seminars to large introductory programming classes. Across these experiences, I have designed and led courses that reflect my belief that computing education should be inclusive, socially conscious, and critically engaged. My goal is to create learning environments that affirm students' identities, foster critical thinking, and empower them to use technology for social good. To do this, I use <b>Culturally-Relevant Computing</b> and <b>Socially Responsible Computing</b> teaching techniques. I typically like to start class with informal chit-chat with some music to get students acclimated and have a welcoming environment.</p>
