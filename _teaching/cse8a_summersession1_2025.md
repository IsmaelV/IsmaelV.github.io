[Teaching Evaluations]({{ base_path }}/files/SETs/Summer2025_Instructor.pdf)

I taught the introductory computer science course as instructor-of-record at UC San Diego in Summer 2025. The course enrollment was only 4 students, which is uncharacteristically low enrollment for this course in the summer (potentially due to the same course being offered remotely, later in the summer). Nonetheless, the experience teaching an introductory CS course as the instructor helped me gain experience designing and delivering lectures for first-time programmers. I also led efforts in incorporating culturally-relevant and socially responsible computing techniques and materials.

All 4 students completed their course evaluations, which are linked at the top of this page.
