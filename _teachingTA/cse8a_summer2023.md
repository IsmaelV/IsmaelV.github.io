I was a teaching assistant for a 37-person introductory computer science course taught by my lab mate, Adrian Salguero (now faculty at University of Washington) at UC San Diego. As one of the graduate teaching assistants, I played a significant role in creating assignments, labs, discussions, and other course content.
