title: "Faculty Implementation of Culturally Relevant Pedagogies at Hispanic-Serving Institutions"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/hsi_faculty_interviews_how
excerpt: "Culturally Relevant Computing (CRC) has been shown to have positive effects on students, including increased classroom engagement, increased computing interest, and increased math performance. However, the vast majority of CRC studies take place in primary and secondary education, with little known about its efficacy in higher education. Despite the lack of literature on CRC in higher education, we believe that there may be CRC techniques presently being implemented in this context---yet not published in the research community. To investigate, we interviewed 21 professors from Hispanic Serving Institutions within the Computing Alliance for Hispanic Serving Institutions to document their implementation (if any) of CRC in the higher education context. Professors reported several CRC implementations including, but not limited to, culture in course materials, language-based approaches, providing opportunities outside the classroom, cultural sharing, and professional development. We conclude by discussing how these results may contribute to the promotion of leveraging students' cultures in higher education to serve students---particularly of minoritized backgrounds in computing."
