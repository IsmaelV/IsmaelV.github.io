excerpt: 'Culturally Relevant Computing (CRC) has shown positive effects on K-12 students. However, little is known about its implementation in higher education. This study explores why computer science (CS) educators at Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSIs) incorporate or refrain from using culture in computing curricula. Key takeaways include resistance to CRC among non-Latine faculty, often rooted in beliefs that culture is irrelevant to computing. Conversely, both Latine and non-Latine professors cited student experience, particularly engagement and belonging, as a strong motivator for incorporating CRC. Additionally, some non-Latine professors drew upon their own lived experiences to create more inclusive learning environments.'
