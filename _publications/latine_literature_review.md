excerpt: "Though there is a known issue with enrollment disparities across race/ethnicity in computing, U.S. Latin American (Latine) students have remained chronically underrepresented for decades. In order to actively support the recruitment, retention, performance, and experiences of U.S. Latines, we must make sure that we are carrying out studies with this population across outreach practices, interventions, student outcomes, and testimonies. To offer a more comprehensive understanding of the existing body of work on U.S. Latines in computing, we reviewed computing education papers that either fully center around or dedicate specific analyses to U.S. Latines. We analyzed 53 papers and found the following results: most research focuses on Student Experiences and Institutional Perspectives with very few studies on Research Opportunities; the educational setting tended to be K-12 with a severe lack of community college studies; there is a low number of popular pedagogical practices studied with U.S. Latines; research has mainly focused on students, but seldom focused families despite strong Latine connections to family; there was a strong spike in studies in 2021; and the U.S. location of the studies tended to line up with the U.S. Hispanic populations, but many states are under-performing. We discuss the implications of our findings and suggest future research directions to better understand, recruit, and support Latines in computing."
