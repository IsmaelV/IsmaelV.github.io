excerpt: "In the United States, culturally relevant computing (CRC) is one of the most popular pedagogical implementations for Latin American (Latine) students. Culturally-relevant learning resources are a valuable tool for implementing CRC. However, the traditional method of creation and maintenance of textbooks takes a significant amount of time and effort. Given the duration required for textbook production, the development of culturally-relevant learning resources may become lengthened, as it requires close attention both on the material and the incorporation of cultural referents. In order to accelerate the process, we used the advancement of large language models (LLMs) to our advantage. Through prompt engineering, we created a series of prompts to produce a textbook for an introductory computer science course (CS1) that incorporates Latine culture. This textbook was evaluated on metrics regarding sensibility, correctness, readability, linguistic approachability, appropriateness of examples, and cultural relevance. Overall, the generated textbook was mainly sensible, correct, readable, and linguistically approachable. Code examples were not always appropriate due to the usage of libraries that are not typically used in a CS1 course. The cultural relevance was apparent, but it often included surface-level cultural referents. The main incorporation of culture was through geographical locations and people's names. This suggests that the use of LLMs to generate textbooks may serve as a valuable first step for writing culturally-relevant learning resources. Though this study focuses on Latines, our results and prompts may be applicable for generating culturally-relevant CS1 textbooks for other cultures."
