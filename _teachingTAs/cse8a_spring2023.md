[Teaching Evaluations]({{ base_path }}/files/SETs/Spring2023_TA.pdf)

I was a teaching assistant for a 191-person introductory computer science course taught by Mai Elsherif at UC San Diego. As one of the graduate teaching assistants, I played a significant role in creating assignments, labs, discussions, and other course content. I also stepped in as the instructor several times while the instructor of record was away for work travel.
